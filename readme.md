####String Art - A fork from [Exception1984/StringArt](Exception1984/StringArt)

#### Matlab

The software to generate the path files is written in [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). It will not work in [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) yet.

Simply start one of the example files, e.g. example_einstein.m

#### Python

The conversion to gcode is currently written in Python. The python scripts are in [this folder](https://github.com/bdring/StringArt/tree/master/python).

#### Ready Examples

Paths that are already generated are in the [ready_examples](https://github.com/bdring/StringArt/tree/master/ready_examples) folder with low res previews.
